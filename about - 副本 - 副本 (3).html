				<h3>SATELLITE</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="about-info">
				<p>A satellite refers to a natural celestial body that orbits a planet in a closed orbit and performs periodic operations. Artificial satellites are also commonly referred to as satellites. Artificial satellites are devices built by humans and launched into space using space vehicles such as rockets and space shuttles to orbit the Earth or other planets like natural satellites. Often gas planets have many satellites. The eight major planets have a total of 218 satellites, and except for Mercury and Venus, all other planets have satellites orbiting them. In terms of the number of satellites, Saturn has 82, Jupiter has 92, Uranus has 27, Neptune has 14, Mars has 2, and Earth has 1. The volume and mass of different satellites vary greatly, with 7 satellites having a radius greater than 1000 kilometers, and the moon being one of them.
					<p>A satellite is a celestial body that orbits a planet periodically in a closed orbit. However, if two celestial bodies have the same mass, the system they form is generally called a binary planetary system, rather than a planet and a natural satellite. Usually, the mass centers of two celestial bodies are located within the planets. Therefore, some astronomers believe that Pluto and Ganymede should be classified as binary planets, but the discovery of two new Ganymedes in 2005 further complicated the problem.
					<p>The moon is the most obvious example of a natural satellite. In the solar system, except for Mercury and Venus, all other planets have natural satellites. There are at least 160 known natural satellites in the solar system, including larger fragments that make up planetary rings. Natural satellites refer to planets that orbit planets, which in turn orbit stars. For example, in the solar system, the sun is a star, and our Earth and other planets orbit the sun. The moon, moon, moon, moon, and other planets orbit our Earth and other planets, and these planets are called the natural satellites of planets. Jupiter has the most natural satellites, with 92 known. Saturn has the second most natural satellites, with 83 known. Natural satellites vary in size and vary greatly from one another. Some of them have a diameter of only a few thousand meters, such as the two small moons on Mars, as well as some small moons around Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. There are also a few that are larger than Mercury, such as Titan, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which have a diameter of over 5200 kilometers.s</p>

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
