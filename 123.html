						<p>Astronomical objects, also known as stars, refer to objects in space and, more broadly, to all individuals in the universe. The agglomeration of celestial bodies forms the research objects of various astronomical states. Celestial body is the real existence of space matter in the universe, and it is also a general name for various stars and interstellar matter.</p>
						<p>Celestial bodies, also known as celestial bodies, refer to objects in space, and more broadly, all individuals in the universe. The aggregation of celestial bodies has led to the formation of research objects in various astronomical states. Celestial bodies refer to the true existence of matter in the universe, and are also a general term for various celestial bodies and interstellar matter. Artificial satellites, spacecraft, space laboratories, lunar probes, planetary probes, etc. launched and operated by humans in space are called artificial celestial bodies.</p>
						<p>Celestial bodies are a collective term for all celestial bodies in the universe. Such as the sun, planets, dwarf planets, satellites, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, interstellar matter in the solar system, stars, star clusters, nebulae, interstellar matter, and interstellar matter in the Milky Way. Infrared sources, ultraviolet sources, radio sources, X-ray sources discovered through radio and space detection methods, and Î³ Ray sources are also celestial bodies.</p>
						<p>To determine whether a substance is a celestial body, it can be summarized by "three looks": first, to see if it is a form of existence of matter in the universe. Although interstellar matter cannot be seen with the naked eye, it is a celestial body; The second is to see if it is material from the universe, and if a certain part of the celestial body is not a celestial body; The third is to see if it is located in the Earth's atmosphere. Those located in outer space are celestial bodies, while those located in the Earth's atmosphere are not celestial bodies.</p>

						<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
						<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
						<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
						<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
						<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
						<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
