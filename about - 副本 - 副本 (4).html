				<h3>space station</h3>

			<div class="about-info">
				<p>Space stations, also known as space stations or space stations. It is a manned spacecraft that operates in low Earth orbit for a long time, can be visited by multiple astronauts, and can work and live for a long time. Space stations are divided into two types: single module space stations and multi module space stations. A single module space station can be launched into orbit by a space vehicle at once, while a multi module space station is assembled in space by batches of space vehicles that send each module into orbit. All facilities necessary for human habitation are required in the space station, as it does not have the ability to return to Earth.
				<p>The characteristics of a space station are its large volume, complex structure, long orbital flight time, multiple functions, and the ability to carry out a wide range of space research projects.
				<p>One of the characteristics of a space station is its economy. For example, all space stations do not have the function of returning to the ground but instead accept astronauts for experiments in space, which can make manned spacecraft a tool for transporting only astronauts, thereby simplifying the structure of the space station, reducing its engineering design difficulty and space costs. In addition, the space station can carry or not carry passengers during operation. As long as the astronauts start and debug it, it can continue to work as usual, conduct regular inspections, and achieve results at that time. This can shorten the time astronauts spend in space, reduce a lot of expenses, and when the space station malfunctions, it can be repaired and replaced in space, extending the lifespan of the spacecraft. Increasing the usage period can also reduce space costs. Because the space station can fly for a long time (several months or years), it ensures the continuity and depth of space research work, which plays an important role in the gradual deepening of research and the improvement of research quality.

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
