				<h3>Astronomy</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="about-info">
				<p>Astronomy is the discipline that studies celestial bodies, the structure, and development of the universe in space. The content includes the structure, properties, and operational laws of celestial bodies. Astronomy is an ancient science that has held an important position since the history of human civilization.
					<p>Mainly by observing the radiation emitted by celestial bodies to Earth, discovering and measuring their positions, exploring their motion patterns, studying their physical properties, chemical composition, internal structure, energy sources, and evolution laws.
					<p>In the long history of astronomy, with the improvement and development of research methods, astrometry, astromechanics, and astrophysics have been established successively.
					<p>Astronomical research has great practical significance for our lives and has a significant impact on human views of nature. Ancient astronomers determined time, direction, and calendar by observing the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies and phenomena. This is also the beginning of astrometry. If we start from observing celestial bodies and recording celestial phenomena, the history of astronomy has been at least five to six thousand years. Astronomy holds a very important position in the early history of human civilization. The pyramids in Egypt and Stonehenge in Europe are both famous prehistoric astronomical sites</p>

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
