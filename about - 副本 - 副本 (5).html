				<h3>Artificial satellite</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="about-info">
				<p>Artificial satellites are unmanned spacecraft that orbit the Earth in space. Artificial satellites generally orbit the Earth according to the laws of celestial mechanics, but their actual motion is very complex due to the influence of non spherical gravitational fields, atmospheric resistance, solar gravity, lunar gravity, and light pressure on different orbits. Artificial satellites are the spacecraft with the largest number of launches, the widest range of applications, and the fastest development. The number of artificial satellite launches accounts for over 90% of the total number of spacecraft launches.
				<P>Artificial satellites can be divided into three categories: scientific satellites, technological experimental satellites, and application satellites. Science satellites are satellites used for scientific exploration and research, mainly including space physics exploration satellites and astronomical satellites, used to study the atmosphere, radiation belts, magnetosphere, cosmic rays, solar radiation, etc. of a certain planet, and can observe other celestial bodies. Most artificial satellites in the world are artificial Earth satellites, and there are also artificial Mars satellites.
				<P>Artificial satellites are the spacecraft with the largest number of launches, the widest range of applications, and the fastest development. Artificial satellites are divided into low orbit satellites, medium high orbit satellites, various artificial satellites, geostationary satellites, sun synchronous satellites, large elliptical orbit satellites, and polar orbit satellites according to their different operating orbits; According to their purposes, artificial satellites can be further divided into communication satellites, meteorological satellites, reconnaissance satellites, navigation satellites, geodetic satellites, interception satellites, etc. These diverse and versatile artificial satellites have made tremendous contributions to humanity.

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
