				<h3>FIXED STAR</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="about-info">
				<p>A star is a giant sphere composed of glowing plasma, mainly hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of heavier elements. On a sunny night, there are always countless light spots embedded in the night sky, among which, except for a few planets, the vast majority are stars. The sun is the closest star to Earth, and almost all stars visible at night are located within the Milky Way. Among the approximately 300 billion stars in the Milky Way system, humans can only observe a small portion. Human observation of stars has a long history and there are many methods of observation. Those brighter stars are divided into constellations and star clusters, some of which have proprietary names. The brightness of a star is called magnitude, and the brighter the star, the lower its magnitude. Astronomers have also compiled star catalogs for the convenience of research.
					Stars undergo nuclear fusion in their core to generate energy and transmit it outward, which then radiates from the surface to outer space. Once the nuclear reaction in the core is exhausted, the life of the star is about to come to an end. At the end of life, stars also contain degenerate matter. The difference in size and mass of stars can lead to different outcomes: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.
					Two or more stars bound by gravity can form binary or convergent stars, and when such stars are in relatively close orbits, the exchange of matter between them can have a significant impact on their evolution.
					In 2023, astronomical research suggests that planets located in the habitable zone of metal poor stars may be the best places to search for potential life. In 2024, Italian astronomers first calculated the weight of water vapor around a star</p>

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
