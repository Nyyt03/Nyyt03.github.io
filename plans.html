					<p>The space exploration program nurtures approximately 1000 technological innovations every year, which greatly improve the quality of human life and help us develop more high-performance kitchen equipment, farm equipment, sewing machines, radio equipment, ships, airplanes, weather forecasting and storm warning systems, communication equipment, medical equipment, and other daily necessities.
						<p>Although space exploration cannot directly help humanity solve the problem of famine, many new technologies and methods nurtured by this exploration program will bring benefits to humanity far beyond the costs paid,
						<p>Space exploration is a catalyst for nurturing new technologies and promoting basic scientific research, and its role cannot be compared to any other activity. To some extent, war also has a profound impact on the technological progress of human society, but it also brings pain, death, and destruction. If there is no longer an arms race between countries to develop weapons such as bombers and rockets, and no more wars break out, but rather a competition in the field of space exploration, humanity can avoid many hardships.
						<p>The ultimate goal of space exploration is to build a better human home, and all scientific knowledge and new technologies developed during the exploration process will be used to improve the quality of human life. Space exploration not only provides humans with a mirror to examine themselves, but also brings us new technologies, new challenges, and a spirit of enterprising spirit, as well as a positive and confident attitude when facing severe real-world problems. I believe that what humanity has learned from the universe fully confirms Albert Schweitzer's famous saying: "I look at the future with great concern, but still full of beautiful hope.".</p>

						<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
						<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
						<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
						<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
						<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
						<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
