						<h1><a href="#">Astronomy and Galaxies.</a></h1>
						<p>Galaxy, also known as Cosmic Island, originates from the Greek word for“ γαλαξίας”  Galaxias, an operating system composed of exponentially massive stellar systems and interstellar dust. Galaxies are the fundamental units that make up the universe. Referring to the Milky Way, it is a large galaxy that contains stars, gas, cosmic dust, and dark matter, and is bound by gravity. </p>

							<a href="#">Supernova explosion</a>
							<p>A supernova explosion is a violent explosion experienced by certain stars towards the end of their evolution. These explosions are extremely bright, and the sudden electromagnetic radiation during the process can often illuminate the entire galaxy in which they are located, and can last for several weeks to months before gradually decaying and becoming invisible. During this period, the energy radiated by a supernova can be comparable to the total radiation energy of the Sun throughout its lifetime</p>

							<a href="#">black hole</a>
							<p>Black holes are a dense celestial body predicted by general relativity and exist in space. The gravitational force of a black hole is extremely strong, causing the escape velocity within the event horizon to be greater than the speed of light. Therefore, a black hole is a celestial body with a curvature of spacetime that cannot escape light from its event horizon.</p>

						<div class="special-grid spe-grid">
							<img src="images/234.jpg" title="image-name" />
							<a href="#">White Cave</a>
							<p>A white cave is a strong gravitational source, and its external gravitational properties are the same as those of a black hole. A white hole can accrete surrounding matter to the boundary to form a layer of matter. The white hole theory can mainly be used to explain some high-energy celestial phenomena.</p>

						<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
						<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
						<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
						<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
						<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
						<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
