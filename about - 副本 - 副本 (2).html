				<h3>PLANET</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="about-info">
				<p>Planets usually refer to celestial bodies that do not emit light and orbit stars. Its revolution direction is often the same as the rotation direction of the star it orbits.
					<p>Generally speaking, planets need to have a certain mass, which must be large enough and approximately spherical in shape, and cannot undergo nuclear fusion reactions like stars themselves. Planets begin as microscopic particles of sand or ash like dust.
					<p>There are five planets visible to the naked eye in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In addition, Earth itself is also a planet.
					<p>In 2023, a research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported on the process of a planet (ZTF SLRN-2020) being "engulfed" by its host star.
					<p>The names of planets in history come from their positions not being fixed in the sky, just as they walk in the starry sky. The five planets visible to the naked eye in the solar system, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have been discovered by humans since prehistoric times. In the 16th century, the heliocentric theory replaced the geocentric theory, and humans learned that the Earth itself was also a planet.
					<p>After the invention of telescopes and the discovery of universal gravitation, humans discovered Uranus, Neptune, Pluto (which has been reclassified as a dwarf planet), as well as numerous asteroids. At the end of the 20th century, humans also discovered planets in star systems outside the solar system. As of May 8, 2016, humans have discovered 2125 planets outside the solar system.</p>

				<h3>SENTIMENT :</h3>
				<p>Stars, those bright points of light twinkling in the sky, have inspired people's endless reverie and praise since ancient times. They are the poetry of the universe, the painting of the night sky, the witness of time, and the starting point of dreams.</p>
				<p>The magnificence of the stars is breathtaking. When night falls and all is silent, they are the only ones hanging in the sky, tirelessly illuminating the world. Their light has passed through the endless space of the universe, after billions of years of time, and finally reached our sight, becoming the sea of stars in our eyes. This magnificence and distance, let people live in awe, but also let people have a deeper understanding of the small and precious life.</p>
				<p>The eternity of the stars makes people yearn. They are like beacons in the universe, no matter how the world changes, they always stick to their position, silently shining the universe. This kind of eternity and stability makes people feel the depth and thick of time, and also makes people full of hope and expectation for the future.</p>
				<P>The dream of stars inspires people's desire to explore. In the vast sky, every star is like an unknown world, waiting for us to uncover their mystery. It is this kind of unknown and exploration that drives human beings to constantly move forward to pursue higher technology, deeper cognition and broader vision.</P>
				<p>Therefore, I praise the stars. They are not only a landscape in the sky, but also a strength and faith in our hearts. They let us see the beauty and wonder of life, but also let us understand the value and significance of time. While praising the stars, we are also praising life, praising time, and praising the future.</p>
